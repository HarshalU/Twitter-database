# Twitter-database
This is database project for twitter on the current trend in twitter

The data was scrapped from twitter, this data was later used to populate the table which adhered to the 3NF form 

Later quries were run to get information.

some of them were:-

  1. Tweets, users and languages.

  How many tweets are there in total?

  How are these tweets distributed across languages? Write a query that shows, for every language (user_lang) the number of tweets in that language.

  Compute, for each language, the fraction of total tweets that have that language setting, as well as the fraction of the number of users that have that language setting.

  2. Retweeting habits.

  What fraction of the tweets are retweets?

  Compute the average number of retweets per tweet.

  What fraction of the tweets are never retweeted?

  What fraction of the tweets are retweeted fewer times than the average number of retweets (and what does this say about the distribution)?

  3. Hashtags.

  What is the number of distinct hashtags found in these tweets?

  What are the top ten most popular hashtags, by number of usages?

  Write a query giving, for each language, the top three most popular hashtags in that language.

  4. Replies.

  How many tweets are neither replies, nor replied to?

  If a user user1 replies to another user user2, what is the probability that they have the same language setting?

  How does this compare to the probability that two arbitrary users have the same language setting?
